# USD to EGP Currency Convertor
This script (using Python 3.12) starts by printing the current exchange rate for USD to EGP from the Central Bank of Egypt. It then asks the user how many dollars they have and calculates the equivalent amount in Egyptian pounds (EGP). The result is rounded to two decimal places for accuracy.

Next, the script asks for the user's name and capitalizes the first letter. Finally, it displays a personalized message showing the user's name and the amount they have in EGP.

There is no loop in this script; instead, it uses straightforward steps to get input, perform a calculation, and then output a result.
